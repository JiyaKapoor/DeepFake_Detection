# DeepFake_Detection
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built to detect deepfake images. The goal of this project is to contribute toward combating the spread of manipulated media by building an automated system capable of identifying synthetically generated facial images.

 Overview
Deepfake technologies have grown rapidly, leading to widespread concerns over media trustworthiness. This project leverages a CNN-based binary classifier to distinguish between real and fake images, with a focus on deepfake-generated faces.
